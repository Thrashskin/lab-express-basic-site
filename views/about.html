            <p class="bio">Tom Marvolo Riddle (31 December 1926[14] – 2 May 1998), later known as Lord Voldemort or, alternatively as You-Know-Who, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, or the Dark Lord, was an 
                English half-blood wizard considered to have been the most powerful and dangerous Dark Wizard of all time. He was amongst the greatest wizards to have ever lived, often considered to 
                be the second most powerful wizard in history, his only superior being Albus Dumbledore. The only child and son of Tom and Merope Riddle (née Gaunt), Riddle was raised in the Muggle-run 
                Wool's Orphanage after his father abandoned his new family on the streets of London when the potion's influence was lifted, and his mother died moments after giving birth to and naming 
                him after his father and maternal grandfather, Marvolo Gaunt. <br>
